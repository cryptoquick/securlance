      I love to draw and paint fantasy creatures, monsters, furries and masculine beings, especially humans and goblins.

      My dream is to make this a full-time enterprise and realize not only my own fantasy worlds and stories, but to help others visualize their own.
      
      I hope to eventually produce art for visual novels and comics.
